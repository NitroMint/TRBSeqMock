# TRBSeqMock
The code is designed to create the TRB seq after a pre-set single-cell data from healthy donor.

Using a distribution interpreted by IMonitor as a preset, it can simulate insertions and deletions on the distribution, and adopt the *01 type and 20% of *02 gender (VJ gene) in the gene selection.

The program is still under development. If having any questions, contact by email: 2210240103@csu.edu.cn.

## usage:
     python3 TRBSeqMock.py -n <number_of_seq> -o <output_dir>
## dependencies:
     biopython
